Conservatorio aims to give you a small piece of mind in a world where Rdio
is soon to no longer exist. Conservatorio backs up all of your tediously
curated and loved collection metadata including favorites and synced tracks,
and all of your playlists.

See the [Conservatorio web site](http://conservator.io) for more details.
